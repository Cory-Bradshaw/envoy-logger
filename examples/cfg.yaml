  # Which InfluxDB bucket to send measurements.
  # This can be useful to control different data-retention rules
  # alternatively use the "bucket" key if you want everyhting to be sent to the
  # same bucket
  bucket_hr: high_rate
  bucket_lr: low_rate

# Since the Envoy only tracks panel-level inverter production by serial number,
# it can be useful to provide InfluxDB measurements with additional tags that
# further describe your panels. This is completely optional, but can be useful
# metadata for your dashboard
